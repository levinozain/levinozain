**Hey There!** 

My name is levinozain, i am an tech entusiast (not an professional)

I deploy application on VPS or Cloud Server 
and sometimes working on developing backend application in expressjs

My github repository doesnt contains any of my backend project (for now i guess)

Most of my repository contains open source program that i use in my clients company
I'm responsible to make sure application is running perfectly and make sure nothing got into a problem

Also im doing work with my homelab server
